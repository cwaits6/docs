# Homelab Docs

Docs for my HomeLab projects. Built with [Fumadocs](https://fumadocs.dev/)
and generated from Obsidian using the
[Fumadocs Obsidian plugin](https://github.com/fuma-nama/fumadocs-obsidian).

Expect:

- Step-by-step notes for each setup
- Diagrams, configs, and commands I actually used
- Updates when things change

If you are following along with a video, start at the matching page in
`content/`.
