Hey! I'm Cody Waits, a Platform Engineer by day, HomeLab enthusiast
by night. I like to create content over on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@cwaits6)
about how I am building out my DevOps HomeLab. I will post
all of my technical documentation from my videos here so you can follow along.

Say hi on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/codywaits/).

## Start here

- [AdGuard Home setup](/adguard-home/installing-adguard-home)

## What you will find

- Clear, reproducible steps
- Configs and commands I actually ran
- Updates when things change

Built with [Fumadocs](https://fumadocs.dev/) and generated
from Obsidian using the [Fumadocs Obsidian plugin](https://github.com/fuma-nama/fumadocs-obsidian).
